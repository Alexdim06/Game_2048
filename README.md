# Game_2048
2048 is a classic single-player sliding puzzle game that involves combining numbered tiles to reach the ultimate goal of creating a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4×4 grid, where players slide tiles in one of four directions—up, down, left, or right—to merge matching numbers.
