# Game_2048
2048 is a classic single-player sliding puzzle game that involves combining numbered tiles to reach the ultimate goal of creating a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4×4 grid, where players slide tiles in one of four directions—up, down, left, or right—to merge matching numbers.
## HOW TO PLAY
Each turn, a new tile (either 2 or 4) appears in a random empty spot on the grid.</br>
When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one, doubling their value.</br>
The goal is to strategically combine tiles until a 2048 tile is formed.</br>
The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves are possible.</br>
## FEATURES
✅ Simple yet Addictive Gameplay – Easy to learn, hard to master!</br>
✅ Strategic Thinking Required – Plan moves ahead to maximize merging opportunities.</br>
✅ Endless Challenge – Keep playing even after reaching 2048 to beat your high score.</br>
